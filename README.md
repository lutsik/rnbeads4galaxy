# rnbeads4galaxy

This is a simple implementation of a [Galaxy](http://usegalaxy.org) interface for [RnBeads](http://rnbeads.mpi-inf.mpg.de). 
The interface allows to run a complete analysis pipeline, equivalently to running `rnb.run.analysis()`.
Many of more advanced options are not working properly yet.


Requests and suggestions from anyone interested in developing the wrapper further are welcome.
